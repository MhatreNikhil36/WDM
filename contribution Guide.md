## Overview

The Fitness Tracker Frontend is built with React and Material UI, and includes the following key pages:

1. **AuthForm Page:**

   - Handles both login and signup functionalities with fields matching our user schema, including social login options.

2. **NutritionPage:**

   - Displays AI-generated nutrition recommendations and a sample meal plan based on user health metrics and goals.

3. **LogNutritionPage:**

   - Allows users to log their daily nutritional intake (e.g., calories, protein, carbs, fats) for tracking purposes.

4. **GoalsPage:**

   - Enables users to select a predefined goal type (Lose Weight, Gain Muscle, Add Weight) and set associated target values, statuses, and deadlines.

5. **DashboardPage:**
   - Consolidates user data such as goals, progress, and nutrition metrics, visualized with interactive charts and animations (using Recharts).

All pages adhere to our Material UI theme: a white background, black text, and red highlights for primary actions.

## Installing Dependencies

Clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MhatreNikhil36/Fitness-Tracker.git
cd Fitness-Tracker

# Install Node.js dependencies

## Running the App Locally (Without Docker)

After installing the dependencies, you can run the development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Docker Build and Run Instructions

The repository includes a multi-stage Dockerfile that supports both development (with hot-reloading) and production builds.

### Development with Docker (Hot-Reloading)

1. **Build the Development Image:**

   - On **Windows (CMD)**:
     ```bash
     docker build --target dev -t my-app:dev .
     docker run -p 3000:3000 -v %cd%:/app my-app:dev
     ```
   - On **PowerShell**:
     ```bash
     docker build --target dev -t my-app:dev .
     docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ${PWD}:/app my-app:dev
     ```

   The app will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot-reloading enabled.

### Production with Docker

1. **Build the Production Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build --target prod-server -t my-app:prod .
   ```

2. **Run the Production Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 80:80 my-app:prod
   ```

   The app will be accessible at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

## Git and Code Contribution Best Practices

1. **Branching Strategy:**

   - Always create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Keep your branch up-to-date with the main branch by regularly pulling changes.

2. **Commit Messages:**

   - Write clear, concise commit messages that describe the changes made.
   - Example:
     ```
     feat: add GoalsPage with preset goal types and deadline input
     fix: update API endpoint for nutrition logging
     ```

3. **Code Style and Linting:**

   - Follow the existing code style and conventions.
   - Run the linter before committing to ensure code consistency:
     ```bash
     npm run lint
     ```

4. **Pull Requests:**
   - Submit pull requests with a clear description of changes.
   - Link relevant issues and add screenshots if UI changes are involved.
   - Ensure your PR passes all tests and builds successfully.

## Additional Notes

- **API Integration:**  
  Replace dummy data in components (e.g., `NutritionPage`, `DashboardPage`) with actual API calls to your backend. Update endpoints as necessary.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Use environment variables for any sensitive configuration or API URLs. Consider adding a `.env.example` file.

- **Documentation:**  
  Update this guide and in-code comments as new features are added.

- **Communication:**  
  If you run into any issues or have questions, please reach out to the team via our teams channel or GitHub Issues.
